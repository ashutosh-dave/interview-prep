## What are data structures?

- We live in the so-called Age of Data, an era in which data has become an integral part of our lives.
- We are flooded with information, the production of which is accelerating at an unprecedented, exponential rate, fueled by technological advances. This stream of data is changing the way we live. work, and interact.
- To make sense of this huge amount of information and avoid being overwhelmed, we need to organize it somehow, and that's where data structures come in.
- Data structures are a way of organizing and storing information in a computer or a program. They help to efficiently manage and manipulate data.
- We often here the term 'data structures' used in conjunction with 'algorithms'. We here them together so often that we might ask whether they are the same thing. No, algorithms and data structures are not the same, although they are closely related.
- An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions, a step-by-step procedure designed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task.
- A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer programming language. It defines the relationship between data elements, the operations that can be performed, and the rules or constraints for accessing and modifying the data.
- Data structures provide the organization and representation of information (the data), and algorithms serve as instructions for transforming the data. Each data structure implicitly defines algorithms for operations, such as adding, retrieving, and removing its elements.
- Some data structures are specifically designed to allow the efficient execution of certain algorithms, such as hash tables for key-based search.

## Why should I care about data structures?

- Data structures are the building blocks of computer science. They are important because they help organize data, solve difficult problems, improve efficiency, optimize memory usage, and avoid security risks.
- They are essential tools for effectively managing and manipulating information in computer programs.
